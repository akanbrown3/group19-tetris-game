# group19-tetris-game
A simplified implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and Pygame. Features include a playable grid system, falling tetrominoes with rotation, line clearing, scoring, and a basic game loop. The project is modularized into board, pieces, game logic, and main entry files. The project is tested with Pytest for non-visual logic.
