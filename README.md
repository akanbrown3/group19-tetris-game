## 🧩 Module Documentation

### 🔹 `main.py` - Game Controller
**Role**: Entry point controlling the main game loop, input handling, and state management.

**Key Classes**:
- `GameState`: Enumeration defining game states (`MENU`, `SINGLE_PLAYER`, `MULTIPLAYER`, `PAUSED`, `GAME_OVER`)
- `MenuButton`: Interactive UI button component with hover effects
- `TetrisGame`: Central game controller managing all subsystems

**Responsibilities**:
- Initialize pygame and create game window
- Handle keyboard/mouse input for all game states
- Manage state transitions (menu ↔ gameplay ↔ pause ↔ game over)
- Control game timing and frame rate (60 FPS)
- Coordinate between board logic and UI rendering

### 🔹 `board.py` - Game Logic Engine
**Role**: Implements core Tetris game mechanics and rules.

**Core Class**: `Board` - Manages game state and piece interactions

**Key Features**:
- **Piece Management**: Spawning, movement validation, rotation, and locking
- **Line Clearing**: Detection and removal of completed rows
- **Collision System**: Boundary and block collision detection
- **Scoring Engine**: Modern Tetris scoring with level progression
- **Hold Mechanism**: Piece storage and swapping system
- **Ghost Preview**: Calculation of piece landing position
- **Competitive Mode**: Garbage line generation for multiplayer

**Core Methods**:
- `spawn_piece()`: Generate new tetromino at spawn position
- `move_piece(dx, dy)`: Validate and execute piece movement
- `rotate_piece()`: Handle piece rotation with collision checking
- `drop_piece()` / `hard_drop()`: Soft and hard drop mechanics
- `clear_lines()`: Remove completed lines and shift remaining blocks
- `is_collision(piece)`: Comprehensive collision detection

### 🔹 `piece.py` - Tetromino System
**Role**: Defines tetromino shapes, rotations, and movement behavior.

**Core Class**: `Piece` - Represents individual game pieces

**Tetromino Types**: I, O, T, S, Z, J, L pieces with authentic rotation patterns

**Key Features**:
- **Shape Definition**: 4x4 grid representation for all 7 standard pieces
- **Rotation System**: Clockwise/counterclockwise rotation with multiple states
- **Position Tracking**: X/Y coordinates with collision-ready block positions
- **Cloning**: Deep copy functionality for ghost piece calculation

**Core Methods**:
- `rotate_clockwise()` / `rotate_counterclockwise()`: Piece rotation
- `move(dx, dy)`: Position adjustment
- `get_blocks()`: Return list of occupied grid positions
- `copy()`: Create independent piece duplicate

### 🔹 `ui.py` - Rendering Engine
**Role**: Handles all visual rendering using Pygame with modern design principles.

**Core Class**: `TetrisRenderer` - Manages all visual output

**Visual Features**:
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, gradients, and contemporary color palette
- **Dual Mode Support**: Optimized layouts for single-player and multiplayer
- **Dynamic Elements**: Ghost pieces, hold preview, next piece display
- **Statistics Display**: Real-time score, level, lines, and competitive metrics
- **Responsive UI**: Control instructions and interactive feedback

**Rendering Pipeline**:
- `render_single_player()` / `render_multiplayer()`: Mode-specific rendering
- `draw_board_background()`: Game grid with visual enhancements
- `draw_placed_blocks()` / `draw_piece()`: Block rendering with highlights
- `draw_ghost_piece()`: Semi-transparent landing preview
- `draw_stats_panel()`: Player statistics and piece previews

## 🏗️ Architecture & Data Flow

**System Architecture**:
```
User Input → main.py → board.py → piece.py
                ↓
            ui.py (Rendering)
```

**Detailed Flow**:
1. **Input Processing**: `main.py` captures keyboard/mouse events
2. **State Management**: Game state determines which input handlers are active
3. **Logic Updates**: `board.py` validates moves, updates game state, handles scoring
4. **Piece Operations**: `piece.py` handles rotation, movement, and collision calculations
5. **Visual Output**: `ui.py` renders current game state to screen at 60 FPS

**Key Design Patterns**:
- **State Machine**: Clean separation of menu, gameplay, pause, and game-over states
- **Model-View Separation**: Game logic (board/piece) independent from rendering (ui)
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design allowing independent testing and maintenance
