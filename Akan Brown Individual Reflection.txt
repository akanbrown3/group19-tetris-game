Working on this Tetris project has been both challenging and rewarding for me. As the team leader, my main contributions included setting up the GitHub repository to manage our collaboration and focusing heavily on the board.py file, where I implemented core game mechanics like piece movement, line clearing, and the hold-piece functionality. At first, one of my biggest challenges was learning how to properly use GitHub for version control, since I had never worked on a team project with branching and merging before. I overcame this by watching tutorials and practicing pull requests until I became comfortable. Another major challenge was debugging issues with collision detection and ensuring that pieces interacted correctly with the grid, especially when handling rotations near the edges. Through persistence and teamwork, I was able to fix these problems by carefully testing different scenarios and using pytest for automated testing, which was another new skill I learned during this project. Personally, I also contributed ideas for enhancing the scoring system and making the competitive mode more engaging. Overall, this project taught me not only technical skills like GitHub and testing, but also leadership skills such as organizing tasks, keeping the team motivated, and ensuring steady progress toward our goal.
